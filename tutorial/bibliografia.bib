abstract = {In life sciences, the importance of complex network visualization is ever increasing. Yet, existing approaches for the visualization of networks are general purpose techniques that are often not suited to support the specific needs of researchers in the life sciences, or to handle the large network sizes and specific network characteristics that are prevalent in the field. Examples for such networks are biomedical ontologies and biochemical reaction networks, which are bipartite networks - a particular graph class which is rarely addressed in visualization. Our table-based approach allows to visualize large bipartite networks alongside with a multitude of attributes and hyperlinks to biological databases. To explore complex network motifs and perform intricate selections within the visualized network data, we introduce a new script-based brushing mechanism that integrates naturally with the interlinked, tabular representation. A prototype for exploring bipartite graphs, which uses the proposed visualization and interaction techniques, is also presented and used on real data sets from the application domain.},

abstract = {This paper presents two approaches to visually analyze the topic shift of a pool of documents over a given period of time. The first of the proposed methods is based on a multi-dimensional scaling algorithm, which places vectors representing terms occurring in certain years (period-frequency-vectors) in a spatial, two-dimensional space. This kind of visualization enables the detection of terms occurring in documents, published in particular years, or terms spread over different years. The second method uses a graph based approach. Publishing dates of documents, as well as their terms are represented by the vertices of a graph. Terms related to a specific publishing year are connected to the vertex of the year via an edge. By usage of activation spreading techniques, terms frequently occurring in documents published in particular years can be discovered visually. We tested both approaches with 2431 abstracts of papers published in the IEEE Transactions on SMC-A, SMC-B, and SMC-C in the years 1996 to 2006. Our experiments indicate that a number of interesting terms can be nicely separated in clumps according to individual years or periods of time. In addition, one can visualize the emergence of specific terms over certain periods of time and how these and other terms fade away again later.},

abstract = {Collaborative filtering (CF) has been successfully deployed over the years to compute predictions on items based on a user's correlation with a set of peers. The black-box nature of most CF applications leave the user wondering how the system arrived at its recommendation. This note introduces PeerChooser, a collaborative recommender system with an interactive graphical explanation interface. Users are provided with a visual explanation of the CF process and opportunity to manipulate their neighborhood at varying levels of granularity to reflect aspects of their current requirements. In this manner we overcome the problem of redundant profile information in CF systems, in addition to providing an explanation interface. Our layout algorithm produces an exact, noiseless graph representation of the underlying correlations between users. PeerChooser's prediction component uses this graph directly to yield the same results as the benchmark. User's then improve on these predictions by tweaking the graph to their current requirements. We present a user-survey in which PeerChooser compares favorably against a benchmark CF algorithm.},

For a given ordering of nodes in W on L2, the one-sided crossing minimization problem asks to find an ordering of nodes in V on L1 so that the number of arc crossings is minimized. A well-known lower bound LB on the minimum number of crossings is obtained by summing up min{\{}cuv,cvu{\}} over all node pairs u,v???V, where cuv denotes the number of crossings generated by arcs incident to u and v when u precedes v in an ordering. In this paper, we prove that there always exists a solution whose crossing number is at most (1.2964+12/(??-4))LB if the minimum degree ?? of a node in V is at least 5. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Convex polytopes. Graduate Texts in Mathematics. 221. New York, NY: Springer (2003; Zbl 1024.52001); Tilings and patterns. New York: W. H.

Moscow: `Mir' Publisher (1968; Zbl 0169.24601)], and about 1990 he initiated especially the revival of the theory of configurations. The author's experience gathered in more than 50 years of scientific work is of great benefit for the reader. The text is both interesting and attractive and it is a pleasure to read it because the presentation is of leisurely pace and appeals to geometric intuition. The main novelty in the approach to all geometric configurations is the concentration on their symmetries, which make it possible to deal with configurations of rather large size. The author takes the reader to the limits of present knowledge. For further investigation the reader finds a large number of open problems and 240 references which include also historic aspects. The book contains numerous tables and over 300 very aesthetical colored figures many of them comprising more than one diagram. Shortly summarized: This wonderful book will be an essential guideline for every future research on configurations. The text is divided into 5 chapters, each, except the first, begins with an overview and ends with open problems. Chapter 1 (beginnings): introduction, an informal history of configurations, basic concepts and definitions, tools for the study of configurations, symmetry, reduced Levi graphs, derived figures and other tools. Chapter 2 (3-configurations): existence of 3-configurations, enumeration of 3-configurations, general construction of combinatorial 3-configurations, Steinitz's theorem -- combinatorial part, Steinitz's theorem -- geometric part, astral 3-configurations with cyclic symmetry group, astral 3-configurations with dihedral symmetry group, multiastral 3-configurations, duality of astral 3-configurations. Chapter 3 (4-configurations): combinatorial 4-configurations, existence of topological and geometric 4-configurations, construction of geometric 4-configurations, astral 4-configurations, 2-astral 4-configurations, 3-astral 4-configurations, k-astral 4-configurations for k$\backslash$geq$\backslash$,4. Chapter 4 (other configurations): 5-configurations, k-configurations for k$\backslash$geq$\backslash$,6, [3,4]- and [4,3]-configurations, unbalanced [q,k]-configurations with [q,k]$\backslash$not=[3,4], floral configurations, topological configurations, unconventional configurations (comprise 3 types: I. configurations of points and circles II. the infinite k-configurations III. the infinite [k]-configurations.) Chapter 5 (properties of configurations): connectivity of configurations, Hamiltonian multilaterals (the long-standing conjecture that 3-connectedness is sufficient for Hamiltonicity is solved negatively), multilateral decompositions, multilateral--free configurations, density of trilaterals in configurations, the dimension of a configuration, moveable configurations, automorphisms and duality.},
