abstract = {Let G=(U,L,E) be a bipartite graph with vertex set U ∪ L and edge set E ⊆ U x L. A typical convention for drawing G is to put the vertices of U on a line and the vertices of L on a separate, parallel line and then to represent edges by placing open straight line segments between the vertices that determine them. In this convention, a drawing is biplanar if edges do not cross, and a subgraph of G is biplanar if it has a biplanar drawing. The main results of this paper are the following: (1) it is NP-complete to determine whether G has a biplanar subgraph with at least K edges; (2) it is also NP-complete to determine whether G has such a subgraph when the positions for the vertices in either U or L are specified; (3) when the positions of the vertices in both U and L are specified, the problem can be solved in polynomial time by transformation to the longest ascending subsequence problem. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

abstract = {Bipartite graphs are often used to illustrate relationships between two sets of data, such as web pages and visitors. At the same time, information is often organized hierarchically, for example, web pages are divided into directories by their contents. The hierarchical structures are useful for analyzing information. Graphs with both a bipartite structure and a hierarchical structure are called {\&}{\#}x201C;clustered bipartite graphs.{\&}{\#}x201D; A new clustered bipartite graphs visualization technique was developed for representing both bipartite and hierarchical structures simultaneously. In this technique, nodes in one set of the bipartite graph, which are leaves of a tree, are arranged in hierarchical multi-circular style. Then, nodes in the other set of the bipartite graph are arranged by the force-directed method. The technique enables step-by-step exploration for large-scale bipartite graphs.},

abstract = {In life sciences, the importance of complex network visualization is ever increasing. Yet, existing approaches for the visualization of networks are general purpose techniques that are often not suited to support the specific needs of researchers in the life sciences, or to handle the large network sizes and specific network characteristics that are prevalent in the field. Examples for such networks are biomedical ontologies and biochemical reaction networks, which are bipartite networks - a particular graph class which is rarely addressed in visualization. Our table-based approach allows to visualize large bipartite networks alongside with a multitude of attributes and hyperlinks to biological databases. To explore complex network motifs and perform intricate selections within the visualized network data, we introduce a new script-based brushing mechanism that integrates naturally with the interlinked, tabular representation. A prototype for exploring bipartite graphs, which uses the proposed visualization and interaction techniques, is also presented and used on real data sets from the application domain.},
